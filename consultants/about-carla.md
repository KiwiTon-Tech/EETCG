About Me

Hello, I’m Carla Monroe, the owner and principal consultant of Elite Enterprise Transformation Consulting Group. As a certified life coach, seasoned storyteller, and business strategist, I am passionate about empowering organizations to achieve their full potential through transformative solutions. Based in Beech Island, I lead a black, female-owned consulting firm dedicated to driving success in Project Management, Program Management, Strategic Planning, Data & Analytics Consulting, Vendor Management, and AI Consulting.

With certifications as a Life Coach and Spiritual Coach from the Life Purpose Institute (recognized by the International Coaching Federation), I bring a unique blend of empathy, creativity, and strategic insight to every client engagement. My approach is rooted in storytelling—crafting narratives that align your business goals with actionable strategies to inspire growth and change.

My professional journey spans diverse industries, from coordinating production for Disney’s live-action and VFX teams to shaping educational initiatives at Tree of Life International Charter School. These experiences have honed my ability to manage complex projects, foster collaboration, and deliver results under pressure. Additionally, my training through UCLA Extension’s Advanced Showrunner course has equipped me to create impactful, data-driven solutions that resonate with stakeholders.

As a problem-solver and leader, I thrive in dynamic environments. Whether guiding businesses through strategic transformations or leveraging AI to unlock new opportunities, I am committed to delivering tailored solutions that drive measurable success. My work is fueled by a belief in the power of human connection, education, and innovation to create lasting impact.
